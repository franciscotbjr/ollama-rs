# Cache Project Context

I'll analyze and remember key information about this Markdown Harvest Rust project to speed up future commands.

I'll detect and remember:

    Cargo build configuration and dependencies
    How to run tests (cargo test)
    What formatter is configured (rustfmt)
    Project structure and components (ollama-rs, http-core, primitives, conveniences, samples)
    Key features
    Test coverage 
    CLI interactive mode availability 

This helps other commands run faster by not re-analyzing the same information repeatedly.

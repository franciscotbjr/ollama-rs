# Continue Previous Conversation

I'll help you seamlessly continue your previous conversation by restoring all relevant context and progress for this Rust AI agents project.

## What I Remember

When continuing, I'll have **MANDATORY** access to all critical project files to read all of them:

### 📋 **Project Specifications (spec folder)**
- **spec/implement.md** - Implementation requirements and tasks
- **spec/personal-assistant.md** - Personal assistant specification with Ollama integration

### 📝 **Development Tracking**
- **DEV_NOTES.md** - Development progress and implementation notes

### 📝 **Change History Tracking**
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Development progress and implementation notes

### 🔧 **Build System Configuration**
- **Cargo.toml** - Rust project configuration and dependencies
- **config.toml** - Application configuration

### 💻 **Source Code Patterns**
- **All Rust files** in src/ (agents, clients, infrastructure)
- **Agent implementations** (classifier, email, contact, assistant)
- **Ollama client integration** (requests, responses, messages)
- **Test patterns** using Rust's built-in testing framework

### 🎯 **Context Data**
- **Previous conversation topics** and decisions made
- **Active tasks** and their current status
- **Testing framework** configuration (cargo test detection)
- **Code formatting** rules and tools (rustfmt)

## User Experience

You'll see clear progress indicators as I:
- 🔍 Search for your previous context
- 📝 Load conversation history  
- 📋 Review development notes
- 📚 Refresh project specifications
- 🔄 Assess current state
- 🚀 Confirm readiness to continue

The entire process takes just seconds, and you'll know exactly what context I've restored before we proceed with your next request.
